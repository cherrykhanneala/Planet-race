## Character Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Personality First**: Each character has distinct identity and voice
2. **Minor Bonuses Only**: Passives provide 5–15% advantage in specific scenarios
3. **All Viable**: No character is objectively better; choice is flavor + playstyle
4. **Visual Storytelling**: Animations and VO convey personality without text
