## Track Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Memorable Moments**: Each track has 2–3 signature sections
2. **Risk/Reward**: Shortcuts exist but require skill
3. **Hazard Rhythm**: Environmental dangers on predictable cycles
4. **2–3 Minute Races**: 3 laps, 40–60 seconds per lap
5. **Replayability**: Variants keep content fresh

## Planet 1: Inferna Prime 🔥

**Theme**: Volcanic Death World  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Best For**: Aggressive racers, heavy vehicles

### Track Layout: **"Magma Run"**

#### Lap Structure (50 seconds target)
1. **Start/Finish Straight** (8s)
   - Wide launch area
   - Item box at 5s mark
   - Gentle right curve into...

2. **Lava Falls** (12s) *SIGNATURE SECTION*
   - Sharp left hairpin around active volcano
   - Lava geysers erupt every 3 seconds (2s warning)
   - Inside line = faster but riskier (geyser timing)
   - Outside line = safer, lose 1.5s
   - Item box after hairpin

3. **Obsidian Canyon** (15s)
   - Narrow S-curves through black rock formations
   - Falling rocks from ceiling (random lanes, 0.8s telegraph)
   - Perfect drift section (chain 3 boosts = 3s advantage)
   - No item boxes (test skill)

4. **Caldera Jump** (10s) *SIGNATURE SECTION*
   - Ascending ramp toward volcano rim
   - Jump over lava lake
   - Three landing zones:
     - **Left**: Safe, but slowest (+1.0s)
     - **Center**: Standard landing
     - **Right**: Shortcut platform (saves 2s, hard to hit)
   - Item box immediately after landing

5. **Ash Cloud Straightaway** (5s)
   - Final sprint to finish
   - Visibility reduced (aesthetic only)
   - Boost zone in center

### Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Frequency | Damage Type | Telegraph | Counter |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Lava Geysers | Every 3s (cycle) | 2.0s respawn | 2.0s bubbling | Timing, shield |
| Falling Rocks | Random (30% chance per section) | 0.8s stun | 0.8s shadow | Dodge, shield |
| Lava Pools | Static (track edges) | 2.0s respawn | Glowing red | Don't fall off |
| Heat Shimmer | Constant | Visual only | N/A | N/A |

### Track Variants

#### **Magma Run: Twilight**
- **Change**: Sunset lighting, cooler lava (blue/purple)
- **Hazard Adjustment**: Geysers erupt every 4s (easier timing)
- **Visual**: Stunning silhouette racing

#### **Magma Run: Reverse**
- **Change**: Race counter-clockwise
- **New Challenge**: Caldera Jump is downward (brake control test)
- **Obsidian Canyon becomes descent** (faster, scarier)

#### **Magma Run: Eruption Mode**
- **Change**: Volcano actively erupting
- **Hazard**: Meteor showers across entire track (dodgeable)
- **Risk/Reward**: More item boxes (5 total vs 3)

### Atmosphere & Aesthetics
- **Sky**: Dark red, ash clouds, distant eruptions
- **Lighting**: Orange glow from lava, dramatic shadows
- **Audio**: Rumbling, crackling fire, rock slides
- **Particles**: Embers, ash, heat distortion

### Recommended Vehicle: Iron Hauler
- Stable through narrow sections
- Absorbs rock hits better

## Track Testing Checklist

### Pre-Launch Validation
- [ ] All tracks completable in 40–60 seconds per lap
- [ ] Shortcuts save 1–3 seconds (not game-breaking)
- [ ] Hazards telegraphed 0.5–2.0s in advance
- [ ] No invisible walls or geometry holes
- [ ] All item boxes reachable by all vehicles
- [ ] Variants feel distinct (>30% different experience)

### Balance Checks
- [ ] No track favors one vehicle >10% win rate difference
- [ ] Skill-based shortcuts require 70th+ percentile execution
- [ ] Environmental hazards account for <20% of race outcomes
- [ ] Players rate each track "fun" >75% approval

**Summary**: Three distinct planets with signature tracks. Inferna Prime (volcanic aggression), Verdantia-9 (jungle technicality), Cryon Drift (icy speed). Each has variants for extended replayability. 2–3 minute races, hazards on rhythm, shortcuts for skill.
